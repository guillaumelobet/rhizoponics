Rhizoponics: a setup for root system analyses of mature Arabidopsis plants
===========
## About the rhizoponics setupThe rhizoponics setup allows to simultaneously characterise the RSA and shoot development from seedling to adult stages, i.e. from seed to seed. This system offers the advantages of hydroponics such as control of root environment and easy access to the roots for measurements or sampling. Being completely movable and low cost, it can be used in controlled cabinets. 

## About this repository

This repository contains all the digital files related to the rhizoponics setup. These include: 

- The blueprints
- The 3D files (needs FreeCAD to open)
- The image analysis macro (to use in ImageJ)
- Examples of raw images 
- Scripts and data used for the figures in the article
