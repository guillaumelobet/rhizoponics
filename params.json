This system offers the advantages of hydroponics such as control of root environment and easy access to the roots for measurements or sampling. Being completely movable and low cost, it can be used in controlled cabinets.\r\n\r\n![](/img/cover.png)\r\n\r\n### About this repository\r\n\r\nThis repository contains all the digital files related to the rhizoponics setup. These include:\r\n\r\n- The blueprints\r\n- The 3D files (needs FreeCAD to open)\r\n- The image analysis macro (to use in ImageJ)\r\n- Examples of raw images\r\n- Scripts and data used for the figures in the article\r\n\r\n### How to cite us\r\n\r\nIf you use the setup in your lab, please cite us as:\r\n\r\n[**Rhizoponics: a Novel Hydroponic Rhizotron for root system analyses on mature Arabidopsis thaliana plants.** Mathieu L, Lobet G, Tocquin P and PÃ©rilleux C, 2015, Plant Methods,11:3](http://www.plantmethods.com/content/11/1/3/abstract)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
